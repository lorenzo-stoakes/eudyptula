# Eudyptula Challenge Solutions

This repo contains solutions to the [Eudyptula Challenge][challenge] I completed in
2015.

Since the challenge seems to no longer be maintained it seems ok to make these
public now. However if it comes back in any form similar to what existed before,
LOOK AWAY!

The challenges are a series of linux kernel tasks designed to help ease you into
linux kernel development. I have included the problem statement for each of the
20 tasks itemised by task number.

As of now, ~20,000 people started the task, only 193 finished it, I was one of
the first 100 to do so, proud of that!
